# Pipeline Documentation

This pipeline was developed to use SuperSegger + Omnipose more fluidly in Python. The pipeline transitions SuperSegger(MATLAB) -> Omnipose (Python) -> SuperSegger (MATLAB) automatically.

## Requirements

1. Python  (extensively tested in version 3.9)
  * Anaconda
  * Omnipose
2. MATLAB (extensively tested on version R2022b, but should work with compatible versions of python 3.9+)
2.1. (SuperSegger-Omnipose)[https://github.com/tlo-bot/supersegger-omnipose]
