# 3D Models

This folder stores the 3D models to fit the centrifuge. The idea is to use this device to fix the plate with PDMS to the centrifuge and distribute the bacteria in all channels of the microfluidic device. It is important to print with a high accuracy (1 mm) and a high density (30-50%). There are 3 files:

1. Base: The base that fits into the bottom of the centrifuge (must print 1 and without the locks)
2. Locks: They are the locks to keep the support to the base using centrifugal force (must print 4 locks)
3. Support: The apparatus for placing the plate with the PDMS (must print 2)
